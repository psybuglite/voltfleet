# VoltFleet

VoltFleet is a fictional B2B electric vehicle solutions provider. The marketing page aims to showcase the benefits of transitioning to electric fleet vehicles.

## Design

For the design of the VoltFleet marketing page, I utilised a Realism Webs Design style to highlight the quality of the physical products and their accurate representation in the real world using images and video media.

## Components

A major portion of the website was built using simple HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript. External libraries and CDN used include;

* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
* [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

## Installation
